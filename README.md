# Ubuntu-Slideshow
Ubuntu Desktop slideshow made in Python. As simple as it sounds, this script asks for a folder name (must within the user's Pictures folder) and takes the images from said folder and puts them in a cycle of being the user's desktop background.

To take photos from the Pictures folder itself, just don't type anything.

Make sure you don't have anything important in the Wallpapers folder, as they will get deleted.
